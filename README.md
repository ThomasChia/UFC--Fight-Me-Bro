# UFC--Ready-to-Rumble
Scraping and analysing UFC data to see what actually matters when two people clash inside and go to war.


Things to look at:
- Age difference between winners and losers - histogram
- Reach difference between winners and losers
- Height difference between winners and losers
- Stances with most wins and most wins as a percentage. Tricky as one stance might dominate, so need to fix this.
- Types of finishes (KO, Sub, etc.)
- Does past record affect win percentage, would imagine u-shaped, so more wins better until a certain point due to damage to body. Look at a fighters clock - how many fights do they have to win a world championship?
- More strikes make you more likely to win?
- Look to create an all time ranking
- Regression to have a look at the impact of reach on likelihood of winning
- Add in the machine learning models from betting.
